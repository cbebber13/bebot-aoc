This file contains a short explanation of the directory structure of BeBot.

Sources
=======
The Sources directory contains the base files for the bot.
These are accessed by name during bot startup.
Any file in here is required, missing or faulty files lead to fatal errors.

conf
====
The conf directory contains the configuration files for the bot(s).
There are three types of configuration files:
- [Botname.]Bot.conf to define the user, dimension, account and password the bot uses
- [Botname.]MySQL.conf to define which mysql server to use, and how to log on to it
- Botname.Modules.ini contains a list of modules, defining whether they should be loaded or not.
  This file should never be edited by hand, it's created and written automatically by the bot.
[Botname.] in the first two cases means that you can put more then one bot into the directory
structure, if you are loading them with the botname as parameter to the start script. In this
case there must be a Botname.Bot.conf (with first letters uppercase as seen), which has to
contain all information usually found in Bot.conf (just copy the file over, and edit it then).
Botname.MySQL.conf is optional in cases where you want to use different servers, users or databases.

core
====
The core directory contains modules offering service not directly to users, but to other modules.
Modules in here should never contain any user commands, but just offer interfaces to their functions.

custom
======
The custom directory contains a core/ and modules/ directory. Here you can place your own custom
modules. BeBot releases will never touch any files in here.

extra
=====
This directory contains useful extras that help running the bot, but aren't really needed.
The extras should contain some readme file.

log
===
This is the default directory used for logging. It contains one subdirectory per bot used, in the
format botname@RKx, with botname and x replaced.

main
====
This directory contains the most important core modules of the bot, the ones absolutely needed by
the Bot class to even run without errors.
The files in here are named in a special way: XY-Filename.php. Filename.php would be the usual
php file name, as could be used for any core module. XY together is a two-digit number. These
numbers are used to define the order in which these modules are loaded. Any php file not starting
with XY- as described above are ignored.

modules
=======
This directory contains all modules, which offer the in-game command interface.

themes
======
This directory contains the color theme(s) of the bot(s). Those are simple XML files.
BeBot defines a default scheme.

txt
===
This directory can be used to store text files that are used by modules to be displayed ingame.
